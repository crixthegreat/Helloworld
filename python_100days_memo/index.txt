[days 6]

- *args as function parameter (list)
- use the '_' for the meanlingless varible name 

[days 7]

- use 'yield' to make a generator
- refer to <Python yield Ê¹ÓÃÇ³Îö> by ÁÎ Ñ©·å https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cn/opensource/os-cn-python-yield/

- Tuples is used to store values that are not intented to change
- use list() to change a tuple into a list
- a tuple with only one item is constructed by following a value with a comma 

>>> singleton = 'hello',    # <-- note trailing comma
>>> len(singleton)
1
>>> singleton
('hello',)

- use set() to make a set(collection)
- the operator of set are '&', '|', '-', '^', '<=', ... and so on

    set1 = {1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2}
    set2 = set(range(1, 10))
    set1.add(4)
    set1.add(5)
    set2.update([11, 12])
    set2.discard(5)
    # remove的元素如果不存在会引发KeyError
    if 4 in set2:
        set2.remove(4)
    print(set2)
    # 遍历集合容器
    for elem in set2:
        print(elem ** 2, end=' ')
    # 将元组转换成集合
    set3 = set((1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1))

[day 9]

A class has three types of method

1. instance method
2. static method
3. class method

refer to [day9-1.py]


1. instance method

	the method can be used by the instance(object)
	use 'self' as the first argument 

2. static method

	the method can be used by the class and the instance
	use @staticmethod as the decorator

3. class method

	the class method can return a class itself
	which is useful to creat a specific instance(object)
	use @classmethod as the decorator
